				<h2 class="whatisspacex">What is SpaceX?</h2>
				<p>SpaceX is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company founded in 2002 by entrepreneur Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars. It has developed reusable rockets, the Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon spacecraft and is one of the largest private spaceflight companies. The company has been responsible for several milestones in space exploration, including being the first privately funded company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station, as well as the first privately funded company to send an object into orbit and return it to Earth.</p>

					<div class="feature-item">
						<h3>Falcon Heavy Demo </h3>
						<img src="images/spacex-27.webp" alt="launch of falcon heavy demo mission" class="feature-image">
						<p>On February 6, 2018, SpaceX launched its Falcon Heavy Demo Flight from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It was the world's most powerful operational rocket, and the second to ever launch from KSC. The mission was a success because it sent a Tesla Roadster, with a "Starman" dummy driver, into an orbital path around the Sun, and both Falcon 9 first stage boosters returned safely to a landing zone at KSC. It was a remarkable feat because after all, how else would you get a Tesla into space? üòÇ </p>

						<h3>Starship SN15 Launch and Landing</h3>
						<img src="images/SN15-landing.webp" alt="SN15 Landing" class="feature-image">
						<p>The SN15 made its maiden flight on May 5, 2021 and flew to an altitude of approximately 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) before returning to the launch site and performing a successful landing. The successful flight marked the first successful controlled flight and landing of the Starship vehicle.</p>

					<div class="feature-item">
						<h3>Inspiration4</h3>
						<img src="images/Inspiration4-crew.jpg" alt="4 crew members of inspiration four" class="feature-image">
						<p>Inspiration4 is a historic mission that launched on September 16, 2021. It is the world's first all-civilian crewed mission to space, led by billionaire Jared Isaacman. The other three crew members are Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant and cancer survivor from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Chris Sembroski, a veteran and member of the SpaceX team; and Sian Proctor, a geoscientist and educator. This mission will mark a new era of private space exploration and will be a major accomplishment for the commercial space industry.</p>

					<div class="feature-item">
						<h3>Iridium-1</h3>
						<img src="images/IRIDIUM1.jpg" alt="launch of a falcon nine mission Iridium-1" class="feature-image">
						<p>SpaceX launched the Iridium-1 mission, which was the first commercial mission for the company. It successfully put a cluster of 66 satellites into orbit, which were part of a constellation of satellites designed to provide global coverage for voice and data communications. I have a special fondness for launch mission because I was able to see it in person. It was an incredible experience to watch a rocket launch live.  Watching it on YouTube just doesn't do it justice.</p>
